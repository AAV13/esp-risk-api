ESPset the dataset is composed of vibration signals captured by accelerometers.

ESPset and 3 W Dataset are both for classification tasks.

Random Forest obtained the highest median F-measure, making this classifier a clear choice for using it as baseline for future works in fault diagnosis of ESPs.

k-fold cross-validation (stratified or not) in order to evaluate their approaches. As will be discussed deeply throughout this paper, this approach might not be ideal for this problem, since it assumes independence between vibration signals acquired from the same ESP

#Summary Statistics
display(features.describe())

"""***General***

Rows (count): All features have 6032 valid entries (no missing data).

ID columns (id, esp_id): id ranges from 0 to 6031 (unique for each sample). esp_id ranges from 0 to 10, indicating measurements from 11 different ESP pumps.

***Feature-by-Feature Insights***

**median(8,13)**

Most signals have very low vibration amplitudes in the 8–13% frequency band, but there are occasional extreme outliers (possibly faults).

**rms(98,102)**

The root mean square amplitude near the main rotation frequency is generally moderate, but again, some samples have much higher vibration, indicating possible faults or severe operating conditions.

**median(98,102)**

Most values are very close to zero, but the max is much higher, suggesting a few signals with strong vibration exactly at the rotation frequency.

**peak1x**

The first harmonic (main rotation frequency) amplitude is generally low, but some pumps experience much higher peaks, likely during faults.

**peak2x**

The second harmonic is usually low, but higher values (outliers) may indicate specific faults like misalignment or unbalance.

**a, b (Exponential Regression Coefficients)**

These coefficients describe the shape of the vibration spectrum. The wide range and negative means suggest most spectra decay rapidly, but some have much flatter or even rising profiles (potentially abnormal).

**Percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%)**

For almost all features, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are much closer to the minimum than the maximum. This means:

Most data is tightly clustered at low values (typical of healthy pumps).

A small number of samples have much higher values (likely corresponding to faults or severe conditions).

***Key Takeaways***

-Most ESP signals are from healthy operation (low vibration, low feature values).

-A small number of samples show extreme values across several features, likely corresponding to various types of faults.

-High standard deviations and large max values indicate the presence of significant outliers, which are important for fault detection.

-The distribution is highly skewed: Most values are low, with a long tail of high (faulty) values.

***In summary:***

The ESPset dataset is dominated by healthy signals, but contains a small, important subset of extreme values that are likely associated with faults. These outliers are critical for building predictive maintenance models and understanding pump degradation.

Most features have low or modest correlations with each other, suggesting they capture different aspects of the vibration signals.

'a' and 'b' (coefficients from exponential regression) are strongly negatively correlated (-0.58), which is expected for parameters from the same regression equation.

Features like 'peak1x', 'peak2x', and 'rms(98,102)' show weak to moderate correlations with each other and with the medians, suggesting they provide complementary information for fault detection.

Some classes, such as "Misalignment," show distinct separation in certain feature pairs, suggesting these features are effective for distinguishing specific fault types.

Overlaps between fault classes indicate that while some faults are separable, others may require more advanced modeling or additional features for robust classification.

"""This plot shows the average vibration spectrum (on a log scale) for each class of ESP pump condition. Here’s what you can learn from it:

Key Observations:
Dominant Low-Frequency Peaks:
All classes show a strong peak at the lowest frequency bin, which is typical for rotating machinery as it reflects the fundamental rotation frequency.

Normal:
The blue curve ("Normal") consistently has the lowest amplitude across almost all frequency bins, indicating the least amount of vibration energy—a hallmark of healthy operation.

Faulty Classes:

Unbalance (orange), Rubbing (red), Misalignment (purple):
These classes show higher amplitudes at certain frequencies, especially at harmonics (multiples of the fundamental frequency). This is expected, as faults like unbalance and misalignment often manifest as increased vibration at specific harmonics.

Faulty Sensor (green):
This class has a much higher average amplitude across the entire spectrum, which may reflect sensor malfunction or noise rather than true mechanical vibration.

Harmonic Peaks:
Noticeable spikes appear at regular intervals (harmonics). These are more pronounced in the faulty classes, especially "Misalignment" and "Unbalance," supporting their association with periodic mechanical faults.

Spectral Energy Distribution:
The "Normal" class decays more rapidly with frequency, while faulty classes maintain higher energy at mid and high frequencies, especially "Faulty sensor" and "Rubbing."

What This Means for Predictive Maintenance:
Fault Detection:
The clear separation between the "Normal" spectrum and the spectra of fault classes (especially at key frequencies) confirms that vibration analysis is effective for detecting and distinguishing between different fault types.

Feature Engineering:
Peaks and energy in specific frequency bands (especially harmonics) are strong candidates for engineered features in your predictive models.

Sensor Health Monitoring:
The "Faulty sensor" class's elevated spectrum across all frequencies suggests that sensor diagnostics are also important, as sensor faults can mimic or mask true mechanical faults.

**Spectral Signatures:**

- All classes show a dominant peak at the first frequency bin (~180 amplitude), representing the fundamental rotation frequency.

- Normal (blue line): Shows the cleanest spectrum with rapid amplitude decay after the fundamental frequency.

Fault classes (other colored lines): Nearly identical spectral shapes, suggesting that:

- Most fault information is concentrated at low frequencies

- Fault differentiation may require more sophisticated frequency analysis

- The averaging process may have smoothed out subtle differences between fault types

**Frequency Domain Analysis:** The spectral similarity between classes indicates that fault diagnosis may benefit from:

- Higher-order statistical moments of the spectrum

- Time-frequency analysis techniques

- Machine learning approaches that can detect subtle pattern differences

# Feature Selection & Modeling

1. **peak2x:** Showed strong separability for misalignment faults (boxplot)

So, it is essential for fault detection models

2. **rms(98,102):**	There was clear separation between normal/fault states (boxplot)

Best to include in all models

3. **median(8,13):** Has extreme skewness (histogram)

We need to apply log transformation before use

4. **a and b:**	Has a strong negative correlation (heatmap)

We will use only one in models to avoid multicollinearity

5. **PCA components:** Validated orthogonality (PCA heatmap)

We can use first 10 components instead of raw spectrum data

Final Chosen Model: A Stacking Classifier using Random Forest and CatBoost as base estimators, with a Logistic Regression meta-learner.

Final Features: The 7 robust "hand-crafted" features from the research paper.

"""The analysis provides clear, data-driven evidence that your hypothesis is true. The model is successfully identifying "Normal" ESPs that are showing early warning signs of developing faults.

Let's analyze the plots.

Analysis of the Results
1. Misalignment Analysis (peak2x feature)

This plot is the most telling. As the research paper indicated, the peak2x feature is a key indicator of misalignment. Here we can see a perfect, step-wise progression:

Healthy Normal: These pumps have very low peak2x amplitude.

Confirmed Misalignment: These pumps have peak2x values that are orders of magnitude higher.

Ambiguous Normal (Flagged as Misalignment): This group sits perfectly in the middle. Their peak2x values are distinctly elevated compared to the healthy group, but not yet at the level of a confirmed fault. They are clearly in a transitional, "pre-fault" state.

2. Rubbing Analysis (a feature)

This plot confirms the same pattern for a different fault type. The research paper uses feature a (the exponential decay coefficient) to help detect rubbing.

Healthy Normal: Shows a tight distribution of feature a values.

Confirmed Rubbing: Shows a distinctly different and higher distribution of values.

Ambiguous Normal (Flagged as Rubbing): Once again, this group's feature distribution is in a clear intermediate state, shifted away from the healthy population and trending towards the fault population.

Conclusion: From Diagnostic to Prognostic
Your hypothesis is correct.

This is a phenomenal outcome for your project. It proves that your system's YELLOW alerts are not simply "errors" or "false positives." They are your most valuable leading indicators. The model is successfully identifying equipment that is in a degrading, transitional state.

This elevates your project from a simple diagnostic tool ("what is wrong now") to a much more powerful prognostic tool ("what is likely to be a problem soon"). You now have data-driven evidence that your system can provide the earliest possible warnings of developing issues, allowing engineers to schedule maintenance proactively and prevent major failures before they happen.

"An AI-powered decision support system that provides a real-time risk assessment for ESPs. It not only identifies clear faults but also detects the subtle, incipient stages of degradation, enabling proactive intervention before a major failure occurs."

Suggested New Project Titles
Instead of a generic "Predictive Maintenance Project," you can now use a more specific and impressive title:

ESP Health and Prognostic Monitoring System

Incipient Fault Detection (IFD) Framework for ESPs

AI-Powered ESP Risk and Condition Assessment System

ESP Degradation Signature Analysis Project

"""1. It Loads Your "Champion" Model
First, the script loads the two essential assets you created:

final_stacking_model.pkl: Your fully trained "champion" model that has learned from all the available clean data.

final_label_encoder.pkl: The helper object that remembers which number corresponds to which fault label (e.g., 2 = 'Normal').

(Note: For the demonstration, the code uses mock objects, but in your real application, you would load the files you saved).

2. It Gets the Model's "Confidence" for a New ESP
When you provide the 7 feature values from a new ESP test, the script does not just ask the model for a single "best guess" answer. Instead, it uses the model.predict_proba() function to ask a more sophisticated question:

"For this new ESP, what is your confidence level, from 0% to 100%, for each of the five possible classes (Normal, Rubbing, Misalignment, etc.)?"

The result is a detailed probability breakdown, which is the key to the entire system's intelligence.

3. It Applies the Multi-Tiered Alert Logic
This is the core of the system. The script takes the probability breakdown and runs it through a set of rules (our thresholds) to decide which type of alert to issue:

RED ALERT Logic: It first checks if the probability for any single fault class is overwhelmingly high (greater than 85%). If it is, the system concludes that this is a clear and present fault that requires immediate action.

YELLOW ALERT Logic: If there is no high-confidence fault, it then checks if the probability for the 'Normal' class is lower than 90%. This is the crucial prognostic step. It catches the ambiguous cases where the model says, "I don't think this is a clear fault yet, but I'm not confident enough to say it's perfectly healthy either." This is what identifies the "pre-fault" or "incipient fault" conditions you discovered.

GREEN ALERT Logic: If neither of the above conditions is met, it means the model is very confident (more than 90%) that the pump is healthy, and it automates the approval.

4. It Generates a Clear, Human-Readable Report
Finally, the script formats all of this information int
